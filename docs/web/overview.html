<p class="entry-lead">Get more performance out of your Channel module.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>NSM Turbo Channels is an extension that provides developers with more choice and tuning options to get the best performance out of the <code>&#123;exp:channel:entries&#125;</code> tag.</p>
<p>The un-altered Channel Entries method joins the <code>members</code> and <code>channels</code> tables to you database query and includes a lot of data that you may never even use. This un-needed information increases the size of the data packets that are retrieved from the database. Every row that ExpressionEngine needs to process requires more server resources.</p>
<p>Now developers can specify the custom fields that are returned for a Channel Entries tag. This results in a more economical use of the database giving you, the developer, more control over your website's performance.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Extended <code>disable</code> parameter options for increased performance tuning</li>
	<li>New <code>db_ref</code> parameter to track your database calls in your SQL log</li>
	<li>Specify the <code>custom_fields</code> columns that are retrieved from the database</li>
</ul>
